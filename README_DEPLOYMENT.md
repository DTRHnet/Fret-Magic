This branch was automatically generated by Replitake to help you deploy your Replit project locally on debian.

## Project Information

- **Type**: nodejs
- **Framework**: react
- **Database**: sqlite
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

2. **Setup Database**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_db.sh
   ./setup_db.sh
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**
   - Update the `.env.local` file with your database credentials and API keys
   - The database setup script will provide the necessary values

4. **Start Application**
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh
   ./start.sh
   ```


## Files Generated

- `install.sh` - Installs all system dependencies and project requirements
- `setup_db.sh` - Sets up the database with user and permissions
- `start.sh` - Starts the application with proper environment
- `.env.local` - Environment variables template
- `README_DEPLOYMENT.md` - This deployment guide

## Manual Setup (Alternative)

If the automated scripts don't work for your system, you can manually install:

### System Requirements

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm/yarn/pnpm (depending on project)



### Dependencies

```bash
npm install

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission denied when running scripts**
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

2. **Database connection failed**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `sudo systemctl status postgresql`
   - Check your `.env.local` database credentials
   - Verify the database and user were created correctly

3. **Port already in use**
   - Change the PORT in `.env.local`
   - Or stop the process using the port: `sudo lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`

### Getting Help

- Check the original Replit project for specific configuration
- Review the application logs for error messages
- Ensure all environment variables are properly set

## Production Deployment

For production deployment, consider:

- Using a process manager like PM2 for Node.js applications
- Setting up proper logging and monitoring
- Configuring a reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
- Using a production database setup
- Implementing proper security measures
